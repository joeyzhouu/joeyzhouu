## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Joey!

Iâ€™m a rising junior at Cornell University, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Business and Operations Research & Information Engineering. Iâ€™m passionate about building impactful, scalable software at the intersection of AI and user experience. From developing AI-powered scheduling tools to conducting NLP research on market sentiment, I aim to combine technical depth with creative problem-solving and strong product intuition. Iâ€™m currently completing an AI/ML fellowship at Cornell Tech, and Iâ€™m especially interested in opportunities where I can contribute to innovative software solutions that make everyday decisions smarter and simpler.
